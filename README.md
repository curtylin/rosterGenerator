# Roster Generator
A simple roster generator to make my life.. and other photographers' lives easier

After I take photos of NCAA Football games, I need to caption the photos I take. This script helps me process all of the player's names, positions, and year in school to a nice concatenated string that is usable on a program like PhotoMechanic. 

For example, when you feed the script (in a .txt file):

"1	Tyler Huntley	Sr.	QB	6-1	205	Dania, Fla. / Hallandale HS"

It will spit out:
"u1o	University of Utah senior quarterback Tyler Huntley (1)	Tyler Huntley (1) of the University of Utah Utes"

The script will go line by line in the text file so theres no need to worry about the length or how many players are in the text file.
